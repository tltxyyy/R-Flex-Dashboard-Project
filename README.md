# Stocks Dashboard with R flexdashboard

## Summary of Assignment
- Main aim of this dashboard is to develop a useful dashboard that allows investors and traders to sort through the many individual securities to find those that fit their own methodologies.
- Cleaned sets of data were already provided which we just had to merge and filter to get the relevant figures.
- This was a pair work which both of us contributed to all parts of the dashboard. The parts which I mainly contributed to were the Excess Returns, Industries and Company Comparison pages.
